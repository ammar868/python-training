Python Training Day 5

This README file provide a brief summary of what I have learned in this module.
Methods:

Data Structures Methods:



Linked List:
A linked list is a data structure consisting of a sequence of elements where each element points to the next element in the sequence. Here's an example of a singly linked list:

Implement the following linked list methods:
* `prepend(value)`: Add a new value to the beginning of the list.
* `delete(value)`: Delete the first node with the specified value.
* `__len__`: Return the number of nodes in the list.
* `reverse()`: Reverse the list in-place.


Doubly Linked List:
A doubly linked list is a linked list in which each node has a reference to both the next and the previous node. This allows for more efficient traversal in both directions.


Stack:
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Here's an example of a stack:


Queue:
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Here's an example of a queue:


Binary Search Tree (BST):
A binary search tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, and the nodes are ordered in a specific way. Here's an example:


Tree Traversal:
Tree traversal is the process of visiting each node in a tree data structure in a specific order. 

There are three main types of tree traversal:
- Inorder: Visit the left subtree, then the root, then the right subtree.
- Preorder: Visit the root, then the left subtree, then the right subtree.
- Postorder: Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, then the root.
