Python Training Day 7

This README file provide a brief summary of what I have learned in this module.


Data Analysis with Pandas:

Pandas Series:

A Pandas Series is a versatile one-dimensional labeled array that can store data of any type.
Pandas DataFrames:

Pandas DataFrames are two-dimensional labeled data structures with columns that can hold data of potentially different types.

Key Capabilities of Pandas:

Pandas enables us to perform a wide range of numerical operations on both Series and DataFrames.
Data Manipulation Features:

Pandas allows us to read and save data in various file formats.
It facilitates data exploration, handling of missing data, removal of duplicates, and column renaming.
With Pandas, we can effortlessly select, filter, group, and aggregate data.
It supports the calculation of correlations between columns.
Pandas also provides tools for creating data visualizations to enhance data understanding and presentation.
