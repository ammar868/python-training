Python Training Day 3

This README file provide a brief summary of what I have learned in this module.


Classes:

    A template for creating objects.
    Define attributes and methods.
    To create a class, use the class keyword followed by the class name and a colon.
    

Objects:

    Object is an instance of a class.
    To create an object, call the class name followed by parentheses.

Attributes:

    Attributes are variables that store data for an object.
    To create an attribute, define a variable inside the class body.

Methods:

    Methods are functions that perform actions related to the object.
    To create a method, define a function inside the class body.
    The first parameter of the method should be "self".

Inheritance:

    Allows you to create a new class (subclass or child class) that inherits properties and methods from an existing class (superclass or parent class).

    An instance of a subclass is also an instance of the parent class.

You can check if an object is an instance of a class using the `isinstance()` function.

Method Overriding

    Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its parent class.
