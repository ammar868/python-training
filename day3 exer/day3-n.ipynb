    "#### Exercise 4\n",
    "Create a program that simulates a simple employee management system. The program should allow the user to perform the following tasks:\n",
    "- add a new employee either a Manager or a Developer to the company.\n",
    "- display the list of employees in the company, along with their details.\n",
    "- calculate the total salary of all employees in the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the following classes:\n",
    "- `Employee` class that takes three parameters `name`, `age` and `salary` and stores them as attributes. \n",
    "- `Manager` class that inherits from `Employee` and takes an additional parameter `department` and stores it as an attribute.\n",
    "- `Developer` class that inherits from `Employee` and takes an additional parameter `programming_language` and stores it as an attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a class called `Company` with the following methods:\n",
    "- `add_employee` that takes an `Employee` object and adds it to the list of employees.\n",
    "- `display_employees` that displays the list of employees in the company.\n",
    "- `calculate_total_salary` that calculates the total salary of all employees in the company.\n",
